# Regelsuche – Benchmark-Qualitätsdashboard

Automatisch generiert von `./gradlew benchmarkReport`. Jede Zeile zeigt neben den klassischen Suchmetriken auch Qualitätsmetriken: ob das erwartete Ergebnis getroffen wurde, wie viele Zustände geprunet wurden, e-Graph-Größe, Matcher-Scan-/Cache-Metriken, Saturation-Einsparungen, ob eine gelernte Makroregel beteiligt war und ob das Export-Bundle für diese Zeile gültig ist.

**Ampel:** ✅ OK · ⚠️ WARN · ❌ FAIL
